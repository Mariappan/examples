# Multiclass Classification on Bedrock

In this walkthrough, you will learn how to use bedrock to train a multiclass classification model and then deploy the model on bedrock

## Goals

* Demonstrate how to train a multiclass classification model on bedrock
* Demonstrate how to log metrics for multiclass classfication using the bedrock client
* Demonstrate how to log ROC curve, PR curve, and confusion matrix by micro-averaging on all classes
* Demonstrate how to customise logging of feature distributions
* Demonstrate how to log predictions for multiclass classification
* Demonstrate how to log model explanabilty and fairness for multiclass on bedrock
* Demonstrate how to serve a trained multiclass model using bedrock express
