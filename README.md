# bedrock-examples
A repository to host examples for notebooks, pipelines, batch scoring and deployment on bedrock

This repository is home to the following types of examples:
* [End-to-end](#end-to-end)

## End-to-end

### [Multiclass](./multiclass)

This example covers the following concepts:
1. Train a multiclass classification machine learning model
2. Log metrics for multiclass classfication
3. Log ROC, PR, and confusion matrices by micro-averaging on all classes
4. Customise logging of feature distributions
5. Log predictions for multiclass classification
6. Log model explanabilty and fairness for multiclass
7. Serving code for multiclass classification using bedrock express
