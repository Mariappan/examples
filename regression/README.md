# Multiclass Classification on Bedrock

In this walkthrough, you will learn how to use bedrock to train a regression model and then deploy the model on bedrock

## Goals

* Demonstrate how to train a regression classification model on bedrock
* Demonstrate how to log metrics for regression using the bedrock client
* Demonstrate how to customise logging of feature distributions
* Demonstrate how to log model explanabilty for regression on bedrock
* Demonstrate how to serve a trained regression model using bedrock express
